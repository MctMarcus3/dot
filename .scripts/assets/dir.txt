                                 DIR
                     Directory creation script

This script was created to make the creation of project directories easy for 
a variety of different types of project. 

The script works thusly: 

dir $NameOFile $2 $3
(Leaving $2 or $3 blank will not cause the script to fail)

$NameOFile = A string that will be used to name the base directory, as well 
as the filename of any scripts or project files that will be copied over. 

$2 = second input, four options: 
(-i) Will copy over branding assets (intro, endcard, music)
(-p) Will copy over Premiere Pro template, and rename it $NameOFile
(-f) Will copy over Final Cut template, and rename it $NameOFile
(-n) Will remove script & branding directories (used for freelance projects)

$3 = third input, one option: 
(-p) Will copy over Premiere Pro template, and rename it $NameOFile
for use if also copying intro, or a final cut project
